STRINGS
.length allows you to get number of characters in a string

FUNCTIONS
//Writing a function is known as a function declaration/function definition

example: we want to write code that finds the average of two given numbers
         - this means that well write code that:
               - takes two numbers
               - adds them together
               - then divinde their sum by two
(5 + 5) / 2   // Returns 5

(15 + 3) / 2  // Returns 9

(7 + 2) / 2   // Returns 4.5

Instead of rewriting this equation over and over again we can DEFINE/DECLARE a function

Function declaration
   - defining a function to use it later
   - when we use it, we are CALLING/INVOKING it

   -Function definition consists of function keyword, and these three things:
      1. NAME of function
      2. List of PARAMETERS to functionm in parentheses ( )
      3. The CODE TO BE RUN, in curly brackets { }

So to find average of those two numbers from above, the function would have:
   1. function name, average
   2. two paremeter(num1 and num2)
   3. the code that handles logic of two avereraging numbers.

Know that when you define a function
with parameters you are declaring those parameters
as usable variables within that function.


 However, when JavaScript sees a function definition, JavaScript will not evaluate the code inside
  the definition. It will execute the code inside the definition only when the function is invoked.

   Returning a Value
Every function in JavaScript returns undefined unless otherwise specified.
 - Functions evaluate to their return value
 - once there is a return the function will immediately stop, return value, any code below in function will be ignored

 Great code reads like English and almost explains itself!
 Write good describtive names for variables and functions

 PARAMETERS
   - Parameters vs. Arguments
      - Parameters - comma seperated variables specifies part of functions declaration
      - Arguments - values passed to the function when invoked

CONTROL FLOW
- control flow is the order in which instructions are executed within a program.
   - control flows are modified by using Control Structures - expressions that alter the control flow based on given parameterd

Common control strucutres --> Conditionals

MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE CONDITIONS
coding tip: DONT REPEAT YOURSELF (DRY)

   - A general rule of thumb is that if you are working with a condition that is mutually exclusive,
    meaning if one condition is true the other condition must be false, then you should use an if/else statement.
    - like a coin flip; it can either be heads or tails but not both.
    writng code is like an art become an artist

Now lets move on the the second famous control structure:
