15 minute rule: If you are stuck for more than 15 minutes on a problem with no progress, you are REQUIRED to ask a question

A Good Question...

-It's clear and concise
-It shows that you've put work into it
    - Use REPL to solve it yourself first. If you notice a pattern with how your teacher answers questions try to replicate that pattern.

- Use official documentation - Explore documentation like MDN for questions about syntax or usage of an operation or function
- Ask an instructor - Ask your formulated question to an instructor during work hours
- Ask your peers - Post your formulated question on your cohort's Slack channel after hours
- Take time formulating your question
A good question is specific, clear, concise, and shows you put work into it

EXPRESSIONS

- Hello World!, Syntax, and Comments

In real world applications, console.log should be used for debugging purposes only

- The Boolean Data Type
JavaScript will evaluate ! then && then ||.
     - De Morgan's Law
        !(A || B) is equivalent to !A && !B
        !(A && B) is equivalent to !A || !B

        In other words, to correctly distribute ! across parentheses,
        we must also flip the operation within parentheses.

- Comparison Operators
